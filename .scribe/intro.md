    This project serves as a centralized API middleware facilitating seamless data exchange between two major retail networks—XL and JV. By integrating and interfacing directly with the databases of both e-commerce platforms, it acts as a reliable “man-in-the-middle” system. The middleware ensures efficient synchronization, standardized data access, and robust communication for inventory, product information, order processing, and more. This solution is designed to streamline operations, reduce integration complexity, and provide a scalable foundation for future expansion and third-party services.
